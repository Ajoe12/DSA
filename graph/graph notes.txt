1. Create graph
	a. Adjacency Matrix : Time (V x V), Space(V x V)
	b. Adjacency List: Time->Avg(V + E) & Worst(V X V)

2. BFS graph
	breadth first search
	implemented by queue and a visted vector
	time & Space:- O(|V|)

3. DFS graph
	depth first search
	loop termination condition: 
		1. node is a leaf node
		2. node is already visited


# Difference between DFS and BFS

DFS						BFS

1. depth				wide
2. Pre,Post,Inorder		Level Order
3. Far					Near
4. Stack				queue
5. Backtracking			Shortest distance
