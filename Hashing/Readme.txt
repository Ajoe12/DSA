prestoring and fetching

# Char hashing 
max char is 256
so always create a hash array to push the characters into the array and fecth the frequency of the required characters

# Number hashing
        int    | bool
main    10^6    |  10^7
global   10^7   |  10^8

if numbers are exceeding the size of 10^9 hashing by arrays wont work
we need to use maps, 
Java - hashMaps
